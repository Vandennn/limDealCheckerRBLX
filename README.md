# limDealCheckerRBLX
this is a very simple script that accesses rolimons extensive data to limiteds on roblox (excluding UGC) and will spit out all prices and deal % of an item. Keep in mind I am not the best coder in the world but I do plan on possibly adding a "sniping" function and ways to turn off projected items.
